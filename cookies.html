                <h2 id="consent">Your Consent to Using Cookies</h2>
                <p>Once you have accessed our site, you will be welcomed by a message asking for your consent in accordance with the applicable legal provisions on the categories of cookies you will or will not agree to use on the duration of your visit to our site. It is also important to note that by agreeing to the use of the respective cookies, you will also agree to safely store the information collected by the cookie (s) you have agreed to.</p>
                <p>Until the cookie acceptance / refusal process is completed, no cookies will be used by our site, except for cookies where the site can not function.</p>
                <p>We specify that you will always be able to block cookies as you will see below, as well as the ability to delete cookie information.</p>
                <h2 id="what_is_a_cookie">WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h2>
                <p>An "Internet Cookie" (also known as "cookie browser" or simply "cookie") is a small file of letters and numbers that will be stored on your computer, mobile terminal or other equipment of the user who is accessing this site (more details on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https: // ro. wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie</a>).</p>
                <p>The cookie is installed through a web browser's browser request (eg Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox) and is completely "passive" (does not contain software, viruses or spyware and can not access the information on the user's hard drive).</p>
                <p>A cookie consists of two parts: the name and the content or the cookie value. Moreover, the duration of a cookie is determined, and technically only the web server that sent the cookie can access it again when a user returns to the website associated with that web server.</p>
                <p>Cookies themselves do not require personal information to be used and, in most cases, do not personally identify Internet users.</p>
                <p>There are 2 large categories of cookies:</p>
                <p>Session cookies - they are temporarily stored in the web browser's cookie folder to save them until the user exits the site or closes the browser window.</p>
                <p>Persistent cookies - they are stored on the hard drive of a computer or device for a length of time configured by the website that placed it. This type of cookies can be deleted by the user at any time through browser settings.</p>
                <h2 id="cookie_advantages">WHAT ARE THE benefits of COOKIES?</h2>
                <p>A cookie contains information linking a web browser (the browser you use, such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) and a specific web-server precisely the server that hosts our site. If a browser accesses that web-server again, it can read the already stored information and react accordingly. Cookies provide users with a pleasant browsing experience and support the efforts of many websites to provide comfortable user services: online privacy preferences, site language options, shopping carts, or relevant advertising.</p>
                <h2 id="cookie_life">What is the lifetime of a cookie?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are managed by web servers. The life of a cookie may vary significantly, depending on the purpose for which it is placed. Some cookies are only used for one session (session cookies) and are no longer retained once the user leaves the website and some cookies are retained and reused whenever the user returns to that site (cookie persistent). However, cookies can be deleted by a user at any time.</p>
                <h2 id="cookie_usage">How we use cookies on this site</h2>
                <p>We have categorized our cookies in the following categories to make it easier for you to understand why we need them:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Strictly required</strong>- these are used to make our work more efficient on the site. These cookies do not collect information about you that could be used for advertising or to register your activity on the internet. Without these cookies, this site will not work properly. So if you block these cookies, we can not predict how the site will evolve for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance / Statistics</strong>- these are used to analyze how our site works and how we can improve it, for example, which pages are most often viewed and if you get error messages . They do not collect information that can identify you, all data being anonymous. By using our site you consent to the use of "performance" cookies. If you block them, we can not predict how the site will evolve for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>- they help improve your experience, for example by reminding you which products you have added to your cart. They can record the changes you made on the site. The information it collects can be made anonymous. They refer strictly to our site and can not track other sites you visit. You may block or allow the use of these cookies, but blocking them may mean that we will no longer be able to provide certain services. It's also possible that blocking them prevents us from memorizing that you did not want a particular service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting / Advertising</strong>- These are used to share certain information with third parties we advertise to know how you arrived on our site. We can also use cookies to identify the parts of the site you are interested in. We then use this information to show you advertisements and pages that we think you might be interested in, individualizing the way we communicate with you, or individualizing the content of the communications we send you.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you prefer, you can opt-out. Individualization of content means that it includes information that reflects the interest that you have shown for the content of our pages or offers or promotions that we believe you might be interested, and to improve the way we respond to your needs.</p>

                <p>To protect the confidentiality of your personal data and information through the use of this website, we will maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards.</p>
                <p>We update and test our security technology continuously. We restrict access to your personal data to those employees who need to know that information to provide you with benefits or services. In addition, we instruct our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the confidentiality and security of your information.</p>

                <h2 id="cookie_aspects">COOKIE-RELATED SECURITY ASPECTS</h2>
                <p>Cookies are NOT Viruses! They use plain text formats. They are not made up of pieces of code so they can not be executed or can auto-run. Consequently, they can not duplicate or replicate on other networks to run or replicate again. Because they can not perform these functions, they can not be considered viruses.</p>
                <p>Cookies can still be used for negative purposes. Because it stores information about user preferences and browsing history, both on a particular site and on several other sites, cookies can be used as a form of Spyware. Many anti-spyware products are aware of this and consistently mark cookies to be deleted in anti-virus / anti-spyware removal / scanning procedures.</p>
                <p>In general, browsers have built in confidentiality settings that provide different levels of cookie acceptance, shelf life, and automatic deletion after the user has visited a particular site.</p>
                <p>Because identity protection is very valuable and is the right of every Internet user, it is advisable to know what problems can create cookies. In order to transmit constant information in both ways between the browser and the website, if an attacker or unauthorized person intervenes during the data transmission, the information contained in the cookie can be intercepted. Although very rarely, this can happen if the browser connects to the server using an unencrypted network (eg an unsecured WiFi network).</p>
                <p>Other cookie-based attacks involve bad cookie settings on the servers. If a website does not require the browser to use only encrypted channels, attackers can use this vulnerability to prevent browsers from sending information through unsecured channels. Attackers then use the information for unauthorized access to certain sites. It is very important to be careful in choosing the most appropriate method of protecting personal information.</p>
                <h2 id="changes">Changes to the cookie policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this information document from time to time by publishing a new version on this website.</p>
                <p>Given that privacy laws, state organ interpretations, supervisor recommendations change and improve from time to time, this notice of confidentiality and conditions of use is expected to change . We reserve the right to modify at any time, for any reason and without notice, this information document. Any changes to our privacy policy will be displayed on this page so that you are aware of our policies. The provisions contained in this document supersede all previous ads or statements about our privacy practices and the terms and conditions governing the use of this website.</p>
                <h2 id="tips">Tips for a safe and responsible cookie-based navigation</h2>
                <p>Due to their flexibility and the fact that most of the most visited sites and the largest ones use cookies, they are almost inevitable. Disabling cookies will not allow the user to access the most popular and used sites including Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo and others.</p>
                <p>Here are a few tips that can help you navigate worry-free with cookies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customize your browser settings for cookies to reflect a comfortable cookie-level for you.</li>
                    <li>If you do not mind cookies and you are the only person using your computer, you can set expiration dates to store your browsing history and personal data.</li>
                    <li>If you share access to your computer, you can consider the browser setting to delete individual browsing data each time you close your browser. This is a way to access sites that place cookies and delete any visitor information when you close the browsing session.</li>
                    <li>Install and constantly update your antispyware applications.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many of the spyware detection and prevention applications include the detection of site attacks. This prevents the browser from accessing websites that could exploit browser vulnerabilities or download dangerous software. Make sure your browser is always up-to-date. Many of the cookies attacks are exploited by exploiting the weaknesses of the old versions of browsers.</p>
                <p>Cookies are everywhere and can not be avoided if you want to enjoy access to the best and largest websites on the Internet - local or international. With a clear understanding of how they work and the benefits they bring, you can take the necessary security measures so you can browse with confidence on the internet.</p>
